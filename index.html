                <h1>Hi, I am Emily Yaklich!</h1>
                <p>I am a student who is very interested in computational biology, specifically,
                    as it applies to the plant sciences. I have a B.S. in Genetics and I am currently
                    working full-time researching using computational biology techniques.
                    I have experience in both experimental and computational biology.
                </p>
                <p> In my free time I enjoy running, biking, and hiking (basically anything outdoors)! </p>

                 <h3> Machine learning model to predict transmembrane identity based on sequence features</h3>

                    <p>Model that will be able to classify a protein sequence as transmembrane or not is able to
                        predict with ~93% accuracy. The purpose of creating this model was to build a foundation and
                        familiarize myself with machine learning protocols and now I can compare this model to already
                        existing transmembrane prediction algorithms and then further improve this model to possibly
                        classify specific TM helix regions and/or membrane protein interfaces. This project was completed
                        as part of a machine learning graduate course. </p>

                  <p>
                      Chromosome 19 open reading frame 44 (C19orf44) is a protein of unknown function. As part of
                      an undergraduate computational biology course, I performed a web-based analysis of this
                      protein in order to gather information on the C19orf44 gene, protein, expression
                      locations and levels, homology and evolution, and protein-protein interactions.
