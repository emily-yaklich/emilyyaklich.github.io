                <h1>hello, I am emily yaklich!</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>I am a student who is very interested in computational biology. I have a B.S. in Genetics,
                    Cell Biology, and Development
                    and I am currently
                    working full-time researching using computational biology techniques.
                    I have experience in both experimental and computational biology.
                </p>
                <p> In my free time I enjoy running, biking, and hiking (basically anything outdoors)! </p>

                 <h2> Machine learning model to predict transmembrane protein identity based on sequence features</h2>

                    <p>Model that will be able to classify a protein sequence as transmembrane or not is able to
                        predict with ~93% accuracy. The purpose of creating this model was to build a foundation and
                        familiarize myself with machine learning protocols. I can now compare this model to already
                        existing transmembrane prediction algorithms and then further improve this model to possibly
                        classify specific TM helix regions and/or membrane protein interfaces. This project was completed
                        as part of a machine learning graduate course. </p>

                <h2> Introduction to Python Tutorial Materials</h2>
                <p> In collaboration with my colleagues, we created an <em> Intro to Python</em> tutorial.
                This tutorial outlines some basic concepts and Python use cases in a set of Jupyter Notebooks that can
                be worked through as a group or individually. </p>

                  <p>
                      Chromosome 19 open reading frame 44 (C19orf44) is a protein of unknown function. As part of
                      an undergraduate computational biology course, I performed a web-based analysis of this
                      protein in order to gather information on the C19orf44 gene, protein, expression
                      locations and levels, homology and evolution, and protein-protein interactions.
